abstract = {The effectiveness of existing top-N recommendation methods decreases as the sparsity of the datasets increases. To alleviate this problem, we present an item-based method for generating top-N recommendations that learns the item-item similarity matrix as the product of two low dimensional latent factor matrices. These matrices are learned using a structural equation modeling approach, wherein the value being estimated is not used for its own estimation. A comprehensive set of experiments on multiple datasets at three different sparsity levels indicate that the proposed methods can handle sparse datasets effectively and outperforms other state-of-the-art top-N recommendation methods. The experimental results also show that the relative performance gains compared to competing methods increase as the data gets sparser.},
